# Trading-Strategy-Optimization

📈 Trading Strategy Optimization using Technical Indicators

🎯 Project Overview
- The goal of this project is to explore how technical indicators can be leveraged to build and evaluate stock trading strategies that enable more informed buy/sell decisions.
- By analyzing historical stock data across multiple sectors, we aim to identify which strategies perform best for specific market conditions.

🧠 Key Objectives
- Understand the working and significance of common technical indicators.
- Develop multiple trading strategies based on indicator behavior and patterns.
- Backtest each strategy using historical stock data spanning over 10+ years.
- Compare and evaluate strategy performance across different market sectors.
- Identify sector-specific strategies that deliver consistent and superior returns.

⚙️ Methodology
- Data Collection: Historical price data for multiple stocks from diverse sectors.
- Indicator Computation: Calculation of popular indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands).
- Strategy Design: Generation of buy/sell signals based on indicator thresholds and patterns.
- Backtesting: Simulation of strategies on past data to measure profitability and risk.
- Performance Analysis: Comparison of returns, volatility, and consistency across sectors.

📊 Results & Insights
- Certain strategies showed strong performance in specific sectors, emphasizing the need for sector-tailored models.
- Backtesting demonstrated that well-designed indicator-based strategies can significantly outperform traditional investment methods.
- Combining multiple indicators improved signal reliability and reduced false trades.

🧩 Tech Stack
- Languages: Python
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, TA-Lib / pandas-ta (for indicators), backtesting.py
- Data Source: Historical stock market data (10+ years)
